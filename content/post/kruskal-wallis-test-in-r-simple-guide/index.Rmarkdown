Let us start by understanding what the kruskal-wallis test is.  

## **What is Kruskal-Wallis test?**  
Kruskal-wallis test is a non-parametric alternative to the One-way [Analysis of variance]({{< ref "post/anova-in-r" >}}) for comparing means across two or more groups. The kruskal-wallis test is used when some important assumptions of the One-way analysis of variance are not met.  
These assumptions are listed below:  

1. Absence of outliers in the data
2. Normality of data  

# **Kruskal-wallis test hypothesis:**  

* **H0** (Null hypothesis): There is no significant difference in the medians of the different groups.  
* **H1** (Alternative hypothesis): At least one group has a different median.  

## **Rejection region for kruskal wallis test**  

For this lesson we will use a rejection region of 0.05 i.e we reject the null hypothesis if our p-value is less than 0.05%  

# **Assumptions of the kruskal-wallis test**  

* The dependent variable is ordinal or continuous  
* The independent variable is categorical, having three or more groups  
* The distribution shapes are approximately similar in all groups.  

# **Computing kruskal-wallis test in r**  

### Example  

We will work with the diet dataset for this example. Our aim is to compare weight loss for 3 different diets. The original dataset was downloaded from the sheffield website. We will be using the modified version that can be found here.  

**Load required packages**  

```{r, message=FALSE}
require(tidyverse)
```


**Read in the dataset**  

```{r}
dietdata <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twirelex/dataset/master/dietdata.csv")
```  
**View first 6 observations of the data**
```{r}
head(dietdata)
```  
**View structure of the data**

```{r}
glimpse(dietdata)
```
The `diet` variable appears to be a character variable, we need to make it a categorical variable to be able to use it in the analysis.  

```{r}
dietdata <- dietdata %>% mutate(diet = factor(diet))
```  

**Verify that the `diet` variable is now a categorical variable**  

```{r}
glimpse(dietdata)
```

**See the count for each diet category**  

```{r}
dietdata %>% count(diet)
```


**visualize the count for each diet category**  
```{r,hugoopts=list(alt="barplot for diet variable"),fig.height=3}
dietdata %>% ggplot(aes(diet, fill = diet)) + geom_bar(show.legend = FALSE)
```

**Visualize the weightloss variable**  

```{r,hugoopts=list(alt="density plot for weightloss variable"),fig.height=3}
dietdata %>% ggplot(aes(weightloss)) + geom_density() 
```


**Visualize the weightloss variable for each diet category**  

```{r,hugoopts=list(alt="boxplot of weightloss and diet variable"),fig.height=3}
dietdata %>% ggplot(aes(weightloss, diet, fill = diet)) + geom_boxplot(show.legend = FALSE) + coord_flip()
```  

Notice that the median weightloss for group **B** is slightly different from that of group **A** and group **C**.  

We will now use the kruskal-wallis test to check if the difference is significant  

the `kruskal.test` function can be used to compute the kruskal-wallis test in r  

```{r}
kruskal_wallis_test <- kruskal.test(weightloss ~ diet, data = dietdata) 

kruskal_wallis_test
```  

With a p-value greater than 0.05 significance level we will accept the Null hypothesis and conclude that we have evidence to believe that all medians are equal.
