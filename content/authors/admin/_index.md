My name is Anthony Akhonokhue, friends and family call me Wirelex because of how pationate i am about technology. I am a self taught R and Python programmer (learning never stops for me), i tend to use R more because of how easy coding is with the tidyverse package and other similar packages, and also because of the #rstat community.

I created this blog because i have heard a lot of people talk about how writing about what you do can inprove one's efficiency. So while i write here so that people can see what i am up to i also intend to improve my efficiency. I will mostly write about Data Analytics/ Data Science related works, please feel free to reach me through the links attached to my profile(icons) or see my resume as i am currently available as a freelancer and can also work in any organization that my information fit into.
