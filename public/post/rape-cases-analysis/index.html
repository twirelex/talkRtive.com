<p>The dataset i will be using for this lesson is one i scrapped from a popular blog in Nigeria <a href="http://lindaikejisblog.com">http://lindaikejisblog.com</a> with her permission of course, you can find the dataset on my github through this 
<a href="http://github.com/twirelex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a>. The dataset contains all the news that has ever been featured on the blog from when it started operating to the day i scraped the data (today 20-07-2020). My interest however, is only on the &ldquo;Rape&rdquo; related news.
So without wasting much time let me get on with the analysis..</p>

<p><strong>Looking at the data above it appears that there is still filtering that needs to be done as some of the observations are either alleged, accusations that are being investigated or rape cases that occurred outside Nigeria. One thing that i noticed however is that most of these cases are cases without state in their title i.e observations without state in the state column. To verify this i will filter the observations down to cases where the state variable is Empty/NotAvailable and investigate the observations</strong></p>

<p><strong>After carrying out the final check i discovered that about 2 states were misrepresented, and the misrepresentation was because i had initially set my map(loop) to extract the first state in the title/summary that matches any state in the states i provided.

An example of such case is; <em>&ldquo;A bricklayer from Cross River has been arrested for raping his 9-year-old sister-in-law in Osun state&rdquo;</em>&hellip;. the event occurred in Osun but since Cross River was mention first Cross River was picked..</strong></p>
