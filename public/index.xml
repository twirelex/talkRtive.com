      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-am-going-to-show-you-how-you-can-do-a-simple-and-fast-data-analysis-using-tidyverse-r-package-without-stress&#34;&gt;I am going to show you how you can do a simple and fast data analysis using tidyverse r package without stress.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dataset i will be using for this lesson is one i scraped from a popular blog in Nigeria. The dataset contains all the news that has ever been featured on the blog from when it started operating to the day i scraped the data (31-07-2020). My interest however, is only on the &amp;ldquo;Rape&amp;rdquo; related news.
So without wasting much time let me get on with the analysis..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Load the tidyverse r package&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;require(tidyverse)
require(widgetframe)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read in the data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;blog_data &amp;lt;- read_csv(&amp;quot;C:/Users/wirelex/Downloads/linda.csv&amp;quot;) # 64mb+ in size
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Parsed with column specification:
## cols(
##   unlist.strsplit.unlist.wirewire.......... = col_character()
## )
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;dim(blog_data) # check dimension
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 246585      1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See what the data looks like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;bd_10 &amp;lt;-  head(blog_data, 10) %&amp;gt;% DT::datatable(options = list(dom = &amp;quot;t&amp;quot;)) # first 10 rows

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change the name of the column to something meaningful&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;colnames(blog_data) &amp;lt;- &amp;quot;title&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Since i am only interested in posts/news that are rape related i will filter the dataframe down to posts/news that has the words &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;rape&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;rapes&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;raped&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;rapist&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;raping&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;defiling&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;defiled&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;defile&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;defiles&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;defilement&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;rape_related &amp;lt;- blog_data %&amp;gt;% filter(
    str_detect(title, fixed(&amp;quot;rape&amp;quot;, ignore_case = TRUE))  |
    str_detect(title, fixed(&amp;quot;rapes&amp;quot;, ignore_case = TRUE)) |
    str_detect(title, fixed(&amp;quot;raped&amp;quot;, ignore_case = TRUE)) |
    str_detect(title, fixed(&amp;quot;raping&amp;quot;, ignore_case = TRUE))|

    str_detect(title, fixed(&amp;quot;defilement&amp;quot;, ignore_case = TRUE))
)

dim(rape_related) # check dimension
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 2859    1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now that i have all the rape related cases i want to create another column called &amp;ldquo;state&amp;rdquo; to represent the state each event occurred, i will do this by creating a vector of character with all the states and capitals in Nigeria and then use the map_chr function from purrr in tidyverse to loop over all the titles, and extract the first matched state&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;states = c(&amp;quot;Abia&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Umuahia&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Adamawa&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Yola&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Akwa Ibom&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Uyo&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Anambra&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Awka&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Bauchi&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Bayelsa&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Yenagoa&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Benue&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Makurdi&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Borno&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Maiduguri&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Cross River&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Calabar&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Delta&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Asaba&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Ebonyi&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Abakaliki&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Edo&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Benin&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Ekiti&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Ado Ekiti&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Abuja&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Fct&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;FCT&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Enugu&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Gombe&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Imo&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Owerri&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Jigawa&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Dutse&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Kaduna&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Kano&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Katsina&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Kebbi&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Birnin Kebbi&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Kogi&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Lokoja&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Kwara&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Ilorin&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Lagos&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Ikeja&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Nasarawa&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Lafia&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Niger &amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Minna&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Ogun&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Abeokuta&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Ondo&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Akure&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Osun&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Oshogbo&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Oyo&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Ibadan&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Plateau&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Jos&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Rivers&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Port Harcourt&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Sokoto&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Taraba&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Jalingo&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Yobe&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Damaturu&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Zamfara&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Gusau&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;rape_related &amp;lt;- rape_related %&amp;gt;% mutate(state = map_chr(title, function(i){
  first(str_extract(i, states)[which(str_extract(i, states) != &amp;quot;NA&amp;quot;)])
}))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I will also create another column called date_published to show the dates each rape_related news was posted. i will do this by extracting the dates from each news in the title column with the str_trunc function from stringr in tidyverse.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;rape_related &amp;lt;- rape_related %&amp;gt;% 
 mutate(date_published = lubridate::dmy(str_trunc(title, width = 8,side = &amp;quot;left&amp;quot;, ellipsis = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;)))  
# the date any particular news was published is the last 8 strings in each post
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now that i have the state and date_published variables i will clean the title variable so that only the title of each post displays, all other content is no longer useful..&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;rape_related &amp;lt;- rape_related %&amp;gt;% 
  mutate(title = str_remove(title, &#39;^.*      \n&#39;)) %&amp;gt;% 
  mutate(title = str_remove(title, &amp;quot;.*;\r\n&amp;quot;)) %&amp;gt;% 
  mutate(title = trimws(str_remove(title, &amp;quot;.*comments Read More...&amp;quot;)))
# remove everything before the main title 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;rape_related &amp;lt;- rape_related %&amp;gt;% 
  mutate(title = str_remove(title, &amp;quot;.\n.*[0-9]&amp;quot;)) %&amp;gt;% 
  mutate(title = trimws(str_remove(title , &amp;quot;...       by Linda Ikeji.*&amp;quot;)))
# remove everything after the main title
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;rl_5 &amp;lt;-  head(rape_related, 5) %&amp;gt;% DT::datatable(options = list(dom = &amp;quot;t&amp;quot;)) # first 5 observations

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eventho the filtered data is rape related some of them are just mere accusations and unconfirmed stories, so i will narrow my filtered data down to only the cases that were confirmed i.e Perpetrator was arrested or sentenced or imprisoned.. etc&amp;hellip;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In other not to look too far i will focus on cases 2019-2020. so i will filter and keep observations from 2019 to 2020.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking at the data above it appears that there is still filtering that needs to be done as some of the observations are either alleged, accusations that are being investigated or rape cases that occurred outside Nigeria. One thing that i noticed however is that most of these cases are cases without state in their title i.e observations without state in the state column. To verify this i will filter the observations down to cases where the state variable is Empty/NotAvailable and investigate the observations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;rape_ws &amp;lt;- rape_related %&amp;gt;% filter(is.na(state) == TRUE) %&amp;gt;% DT::datatable()

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Took my time to investigate the posts and discovered that truly most of the cases without states are rape events outside Nigeria, and few cases are accusations that are being discussed (No proof). However, i noticed that very few of the post didn&amp;rsquo;t have state in them either because the blogger did not include state or because the state was written in the main news/post and not in the title/summary that i scraped. I selected the few posts(216,352,42,119,210,247,318,320) and manually researched the states they occurred, (Delta,Lagos,Imo,Niger,Adamawa,Abuja,Lagos,Niger) respectively. Now i will include those states to the observations (i will make use of the rows_update function from dplyr in tidyverse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;rape_related &amp;lt;-
  rape_related %&amp;gt;% mutate(rowid = 1:nrow(rape_related)) # create a variable &amp;quot;rowid&amp;quot; to update by

rape_related &amp;lt;- rows_update(rape_related ,
                            tibble(
                              rowid = c(216, 352, 42, 119, 210, 247, 318, 320),
                              state = c(&amp;quot;Delta&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Lagos&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Imo&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Niger&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Adamawa&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Abuja&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Lagos&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Niger&amp;quot;)

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Matching, by = &amp;quot;rowid&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now i will also look at observations with state to see if there is any that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be there&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It appears that some of the cases are cases where the accused denies and sues the accuser but no arrest or sentencing was made. An example of such cases is the COZA pastor rape allegation case, that particular story appeared a few times, also there are cases where arrest were made for attempted rape (not really what we want), and a case where the victim was an Animal and lots more. I have investigated these cases and will have to remove them from the observations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

class=\&#34;display\&#34;&gt;\n  &lt;thead&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt; &lt;\/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;title&lt;\/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;state&lt;\/th&gt;\n

&lt;iframe seamless src=&#34;rape_final.html&#34; width = &#34;930&#34; height = &#34;400&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After carrying out the final check i discovered that about 2 states were misrepresented, and the misrepresentation was because i had initially set my map(loop) to extract the first state in the title/summary that matches any state in the states i provided. There are 2 cases where the first state in the title/summary was the state of the culprit and not the state of occurrence. An example of such case is; &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;A bricklayer from Cross River has been arrested for raping his 9-year-old sister-in-law in Osun state&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;. the event occurred in Osun but since Cross River was mentioned first Cross River was picked..&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;rape_final &amp;lt;- rape_related %&amp;gt;% filter(is.na(state) == FALSE) # keep only observations where the state is present
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;rape_final &amp;lt;-
  rape_final %&amp;gt;% mutate(rowid = 1:nrow(rape_final)) # create a variable &amp;quot;rowid&amp;quot; to update by

rape_final &amp;lt;- rows_update(rape_final ,
                          tibble(rowid = c(170, 198),
                                 state = c(&amp;quot;Lagos&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Osun&amp;quot;))) %&amp;gt;% select(-rowid) # update the affected observations and de-select &amp;quot;rowid&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Matching, by = &amp;quot;rowid&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some states capital was used in the state column instead of the state, since the state itself is what i am interested in i will replace those capitals by their respective states&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;rape_final &amp;lt;- rape_final %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(
    state = case_when(
      state == &amp;quot;Makurdi&amp;quot; ~ &amp;quot;Benue&amp;quot;,
      state == &amp;quot;Ikeja&amp;quot; ~ &amp;quot;Lagos&amp;quot;,
      state == &amp;quot;Akure&amp;quot; ~ &amp;quot;Ondo&amp;quot;,
      state == &amp;quot;FCT&amp;quot; ~ &amp;quot;Abuja&amp;quot;,
      state == &amp;quot;Niger &amp;quot; ~ &amp;quot;Niger&amp;quot;,
      state == &amp;quot;Port Harcourt&amp;quot; ~ &amp;quot;Rivers&amp;quot;,
      state == &amp;quot;Calabar&amp;quot; ~ &amp;quot;Cross River&amp;quot;,
      TRUE ~ state
    )
  )
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally i will like to represent the data graphically&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;rape_final %&amp;gt;% ggplot(aes(fct_rev(fct_infreq(state)), fill = state)) + geom_bar(show.legend = FALSE) + coord_flip() + labs(x = &amp;quot;STATE&amp;quot;, y = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;, title = &amp;quot;Confirmed rape cases according to state from Jan-2019 to July-2020 as posted on Lindaikejisblog&amp;quot;) + theme_bw() + theme(

)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lagos state, Ogun state and Niger state happen to have recorded more confirmed rape cases than the other states, with Anambara and Abuja following..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;require(lubridate)

rape_final %&amp;gt;% mutate(date_published = floor_date(date_published, &amp;quot;month&amp;quot;)) %&amp;gt;% count(date_published) %&amp;gt;% ggplot(aes(date_published, n)) + geom_point(color = &amp;quot;black&amp;quot;) + geom_line(color = &amp;quot;grey50&amp;quot;) + scale_x_date(date_breaks = &amp;quot;1 month&amp;quot;, date_labels = &amp;quot;%b %Y&amp;quot;) + theme(
  axis.text.x.bottom = element_text(size = 10, face = &amp;quot;bold&amp;quot;),
  panel.grid = element_blank(),
  plot.title = element_text(
    colour = &amp;quot;grey50&amp;quot;,
    size = 25,
    hjust = 0.5
  )
) + labs(x = &amp;quot;Date&amp;quot;, y = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;, title = &amp;quot;Distribution of confirmed Rape cases from Jan-2019 to July-2020 as posted on Lindaikejisblog&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/Data-cleaning-tidyverse-r-package/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-30-1.png&#34; width=&#34;1440&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been quite a number of incident of Rape between 2019 and half-way 2020, despite not being a complete year yet there have been more rape cases in 2020 than in 2019, obviously because of the Lockdown that started in April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;wrap-up&#34;&gt;Wrap-up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tidyverse r package for me has become a compulsory tool for making sense out of data. If you are new to Data science my advice to you is to try as much as you can to familiarize with the tidyverse package, it will make your job much easier and fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&#34;/post/web-scraping-using-rselenium/&#34;&gt;scraping data from a football betting site&lt;/a&gt;  i will now build a simple model using tidymodels r package to see how well it will perform in predicting the result of the games.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are some information about the dataset:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;home      &amp;ndash;&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;A premier league club at home to play against an opponent&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;away      &amp;ndash;&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;A premier league club away from home to play against the home team&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;homeOdd   &amp;ndash;&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;the odds that the home team will win a particular match&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;drawOdd   &amp;ndash;&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;the odds that both teams will draw a particular match&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;awaysOdd  &amp;ndash;&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;the odds that the away team will win particular match&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;homeR     &amp;ndash;&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;result of the home team after a particular match&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;awayR     &amp;ndash;&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;result of the away team after a particular match&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;matchtime &amp;ndash;&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;the time a particular match was played&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;leagueW   &amp;ndash;&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;the week a particular match was played&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;day       &amp;ndash;&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;the day a particular match was played&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;install the tidymodels r package&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;install.packages(&amp;quot;tidymodels&amp;quot;) # skip this step if you already have the tidymodels package
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;load the package&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;require(tidyverse)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read in the dataset and check its dimension&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;bet9ja &amp;lt;- read_csv(&amp;quot;C:/Users/wirelex/Downloads/bet9ja(2).csv&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Parsed with column specification:
## cols(
##   home = col_character(),
##   away = col_character(),
##   homeOdd = col_double(),
##   drawOdd = col_double(),
##   awaysOdd = col_double(),
##   homeR = col_double(),
##   awayR = col_double(),
##   matchtime = col_time(format = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;),
##   leagueWK = col_character(),
##   day = col_character()
## )
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;dim(bet9ja) ## see the dimension of the data
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 14410    10

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we do not have a response variable yet so we need to first create a response variable before proceeding.&lt;br&gt;
we will create the new variable from our homeR and awayR variables and call the new variable &amp;ldquo;result&amp;rdquo;, we will encode the &amp;ldquo;result&amp;rdquo; variable as follow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 when the home team wins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;0 when the game ends in a draw&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 when the away team wins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;bet9ja &amp;lt;- bet9ja %&amp;gt;% 
  mutate(result = factor(case_when(homeR &amp;gt; awayR ~ 1, homeR &amp;lt; awayR ~ 2, TRUE ~ 0))) %&amp;gt;%
  select(-homeR, -awayR) # remove the homeR variable and awayR variable as we will no longer need them
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we have now added a 3 category response/dependent variable and this means that we will be building a multiclass classification model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;some of the variables are represented as character variables but we will need them to be categorical variables for the sake of the algorithm we want to make use of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;bet9ja &amp;lt;- bet9ja %&amp;gt;% 
  mutate_if(is.character, as.factor)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;data-exploration&#34;&gt;DATA EXPLORATION&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are familiar with the way football betting works you will know that &amp;ldquo;odds&amp;rdquo; play a huge role on whether a team will win a particular game or not. So let us first visually see the relationship between the odds variables and the result variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us discretize the odds variables and do a plot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;bet9ja %&amp;gt;% 
  transmute(result, homeOdd = factor(case_when(homeOdd &amp;lt;= 1.5 ~ &amp;quot;smallO&amp;quot;, homeOdd &amp;gt; 1.5 &amp;amp; homeOdd &amp;lt;= 2 ~ &amp;quot;mediumO&amp;quot;, homeOdd &amp;gt; 2 ~ &amp;quot;bigO&amp;quot;))) %&amp;gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(result, fill = result)) + geom_bar(show.legend = FALSE) + facet_wrap(~homeOdd) + theme_bw() +scale_y_continuous(labels = NULL) + labs(y = NULL, title = &amp;quot;HOME TEAM ODDS PLOT&amp;quot;) + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/predicting-the-result-of-a-virtual-football-match-of-a-betting-site/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png&#34; width=&#34;768&#34; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The plot above is trying to convince us that when a team is home and its winning odds is big i.e above 2 then the match will likely end up in favor of its opponent(away team), but when its winning odds is small or medium i.e between 1 and 2 then the match will most likely end in favor of the team..&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;bet9ja %&amp;gt;% 
  transmute(result, awaysOdd = factor(case_when(awaysOdd &amp;lt;= 1.5 ~ &amp;quot;smallO&amp;quot;, awaysOdd &amp;gt; 1.5 &amp;amp; awaysOdd &amp;lt;= 2 ~ &amp;quot;mediumO&amp;quot;, awaysOdd &amp;gt; 2 ~ &amp;quot;bigO&amp;quot;))) %&amp;gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(result, fill = result)) + geom_bar(show.legend = FALSE) + facet_wrap(~awaysOdd) + theme_bw() +scale_y_continuous(labels = NULL) + labs(y = NULL, title = &amp;quot;AWAY TEAM ODDS PLOT&amp;quot;) + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/predicting-the-result-of-a-virtual-football-match-of-a-betting-site/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png&#34; width=&#34;768&#34; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;According to the plot above, when a team is away and it is giving a big winning odds in a particular match i.e odds above 2, the game will likely end up in favor of the opposition team(home team), but when the team is giving a small/medium winning odds i.e between 1 and 2 then the match will likely end up in the team&amp;rsquo;s favor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;modeling&#34;&gt;MODELING&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have an idea of what the relationship between the odds variables and the result variable looks like let us go ahead and build a predictive model using the tidymodels r package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;let&amp;rsquo;s build a svm model using tidymodels parsnip&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;require(doSNOW) # for parallel processing in windows OS

cl &amp;lt;- makeCluster(6, type = &amp;quot;SOCK&amp;quot;) 
registerDoSNOW(cl)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;split data into training and testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;require(tidymodels) # for modeling
set.seed(111)

splitdata &amp;lt;- initial_split(bet9ja)
traindata &amp;lt;- training(splitdata)
testdata &amp;lt;- testing(splitdata)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;fitting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;svm_model &amp;lt;- svm_rbf(mode = &amp;quot;classification&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;% 
  set_engine(&amp;quot;kernlab&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;% 
  fit(result~., data = traindata)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;make prediction on test data and view confusion matrix&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;prediction &amp;lt;- svm_model %&amp;gt;% 
  predict(testdata) %&amp;gt;% 
  transmute(actual = testdata$result, rename(.,predicted = .pred_class)) 
kable(head(prediction, 10))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;actual&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;predicted&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;we can see that there are few misclassifications&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;prediction %&amp;gt;% 
  conf_mat(actual, predicted) # view confusion matrix
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##           Truth
## Prediction    0    1    2
##          0    5   10   12
##          1  720 1253  540
##          2  306  246  510
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;prediction %&amp;gt;% accuracy(actual, predicted) # check accuracy
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 1 x 3
##   .metric  .estimator .estimate
##   &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;          &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;
## 1 accuracy multiclass     0.491
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The svm model produced an accuracy of about 49%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let us try to build a random forest model to see if there will be any improvement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;set.seed(111)
rf_model &amp;lt;- rand_forest(mode = &amp;quot;classification&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;% 
  set_engine(&amp;quot;ranger&amp;quot;, importance = &amp;quot;permutation&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;% 
  fit(result~., data = traindata)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;make prediction on test data and view confusion matrix&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;prediction2 &amp;lt;- rf_model %&amp;gt;% 
  predict(testdata) %&amp;gt;% 
  transmute(actual = testdata$result, rename(., predicted = .pred_class)) 
kable(head(prediction2, 10))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;actual&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;predicted&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 1 x 3
##   .metric  .estimator .estimate
##   &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;          &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;
## 1 accuracy multiclass     0.468
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The svm model performed better judging with the Accuracy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;lets view how well each of the variables performed in the model&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;require(vip) # variable importance plot function &amp;quot;vip()&amp;quot;

rf_model %&amp;gt;% 
  vip(geom = &amp;quot;point&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/predicting-the-result-of-a-virtual-football-match-of-a-betting-site/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;
From the plot above we can clearly see that the odds variables were the most effective predictor variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;observation&#34;&gt;OBSERVATION&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both models didn&amp;rsquo;t give us the best result but from our analysis we can see that variables that are the most significant determinant of the outcome of any virtual football game are the odds variables, the teams involved or the time/day the game is played doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter that much&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an accuracy less than 50% the SVM and a random forest model are probably not the best models to depend on when it comes to virtual football game prediction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;wrap-up&#34;&gt;Wrap-up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shifting from the base r and caret way of modeling can be hard for some of us but seeing how far the tidymodels is preparing to take us (timely upgrade/update) is enough reason for everyone to start trying it out. And also, knowing that the brain behind the caret package is also part  of the tidymodels team makes it even more interesting. I have prepared a short and comprehensive lesson on tidymodels that might be helpful..

      <title>scraping dynamic content of a site with login requirement and iframe using RSelenium</title>
      <link>/post/web-scraping-using-rselenium/</link>

      <guid>/post/web-scraping-using-rselenium/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-this-tutorial-i-will-explain-how-the-rselenium-r-package-can-be-used-to-scrape-data-from-a-dynamic-web-page-with-login-requirement-easily&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this tutorial i will explain how the RSelenium r package can be used to scrape data from a Dynamic web page with login requirement easily.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like so many of you i have also asked myself if it is possible to predict the result of the virtual football matches we play online using a machine learning model. Well, in this post i am going to show you how i was able to satisfy my curiosity with R programming and the package called RSelenium, if you are an R programmer chances are that you have used R&amp;rsquo;s popular rvest package for web scraping but yet to explore the RSelenium package. The RSelenium package is a good web browser automation tool that can serve as a bot in place of human to automate certain tasks. One of the difference between the RSelenium package and the rvest package is that unlike rvest that loads only the html content of a web page the RSelenium package loads everything including the page&amp;rsquo;s Javascript content and therefore may take a bit longer to deliver than rvest depending on internet speed among other things. You can however use RSelenium in an headless mode so that all its graphical content won&amp;rsquo;t display to improve the speed but in this tutorial we will display all content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some RSelenium methods and how they can be used&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$navigate()            &amp;ndash;&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;for navigating to urls pages&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$findElement()         &amp;ndash;&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;for identifying elements within a web page&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$getElementText()      &amp;ndash;&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;for getting the text of elements in a web page&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$sendKeysToElement()   &amp;ndash;&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;for sending values into an input field within a web page&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$clickElement()        &amp;ndash;&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;for clicking elements within a web page&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$switchToFrame()       &amp;ndash;&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;for switching between frames within a web page&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$switchToWindow()      &amp;ndash;&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;for switching from one window to another&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$open()                &amp;ndash;&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;for opening a webBrowser client&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$close()               &amp;ndash;&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;for closing a webBrowser client&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RSelenium server requires java runtime so you need to make sure that you have java runtime installed in your system before proceeding..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;we start by loading the RSelenium package:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;require(RSelenium)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Loading required package: RSelenium
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;require(readr) # we will make use of the write_csv() function from this package
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Loading required package: readr
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;if you don&amp;rsquo;t have the RSelenium package installed you can first use the code below to install before loading for use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;install.packages(&amp;quot;RSelenium&amp;quot;)
install.packages(&amp;quot;readr&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now we start a selenium server and browser with the rsDriver function and store it in a variable named rd(short for remote driver) and create another variable &amp;ldquo;remdr&amp;rdquo; that will handle how we control the browser.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;rd &amp;lt;- rsDriver(browser = &amp;quot;firefox&amp;quot;)
remdr &amp;lt;- rd[[&amp;quot;client&amp;quot;]]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;you should see something like this&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;





  











&lt;figure &gt;


  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;/img/web-scraping-selenium/remdr.png&#34; &gt;


  &lt;img src=&#34;/img/web-scraping-selenium/remdr.png&#34; alt=&#34;connecting to an RSelenium server&#34;  &gt;
&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; if you are using the rsDriver function for the first time what you will see will be different from mine but after the first run your output should be similar to mine (for this lesson i used Windows 10).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By this time your firefox browser is triggered and is ready to work according to your instructions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;





  











&lt;figure &gt;


  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;/img/web-scraping-selenium/firefox.png&#34; &gt;


  &lt;img src=&#34;/img/web-scraping-selenium/firefox.png&#34; alt=&#34;RSelenium firefox browser client started&#34;  &gt;
&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We now have access to all the methods that is contained in the remdr variable that we created earlier, we can navigate to web pages and do a lot of interesting things from now.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;url &amp;lt;- &amp;quot;http://old-mobile.bet9ja.com/Account/Login.aspx&amp;quot;  # url of the site&#39;s login page

remdr$navigate(url)  # Navigating to the page
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;





  











&lt;figure &gt;


  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;/img/web-scraping-selenium/Bet9jaLoginPage.png&#34; &gt;


  &lt;img src=&#34;/img/web-scraping-selenium/Bet9jaLoginPage.png&#34; alt=&#34;the website&amp;#39;s login page&#34;  &gt;
&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now we will use the selector gadget add-on in chrome browser to locate the elements we are interested in within any page. If you have not used the selector gadget add-on before here is a 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://selectorgadget.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to a quick guide on how to begin or use your browser&amp;rsquo;s inspect element option by just right clicking at any particular place of interest and select &amp;ldquo;inspect&amp;rdquo; / &amp;ldquo;inspect element&amp;rdquo; .&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;we first locate the username element and store it in a variable called username&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;username &amp;lt;- remdr$findElement(using = &#39;css selector&#39;,&amp;quot;#ctl00_w_ContentMain_ContentMain_LoginUser1_ctrlLogin_Username&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;we do something similar to locate the password element&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;password &amp;lt;- remdr$findElement(using = &#39;css selector&#39;,&amp;quot;#ctl00_w_ContentMain_ContentMain_LoginUser1_ctrlLogin_Password&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;we also locate the login button element&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;login &amp;lt;- remdr$findElement(using = &#39;css selector&#39;,&amp;quot;#ctl00_w_ContentMain_ContentMain_LoginUser1_ctrlLogin_lnkBtnLogin&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now that we have the location of these elements we can then insert our username and password into their respective fields in the page&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;username$sendKeysToElement(list(&amp;quot;username&amp;quot;)) # your bet9ja username

password$sendKeysToElement(list(&amp;quot;password&amp;quot;)) # your bet9ja password
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;you should have something like this&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;





  











&lt;figure &gt;


  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;/img/web-scraping-selenium/Bet9jaUsernamePassword.png&#34; &gt;


  &lt;img src=&#34;/img/web-scraping-selenium/Bet9jaUsernamePassword.png&#34; alt=&#34;the website&amp;#39;s username and password input field&#34;  &gt;
&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;we then click on the login button&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;login$clickElement()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;it is advisable to pause your script sometimes so that the current page gets loaded completely before your next line of code runs to avoid errors, especially when your internet connection isn&amp;rsquo;t too good.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Sys.sleep(5) # giving the current page 5 seconds to finish loading its content
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;





  











&lt;figure &gt;


  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;/img/web-scraping-selenium/Bet9jaHomePage.png&#34; &gt;


  &lt;img src=&#34;/img/web-scraping-selenium/Bet9jaHomePage.png&#34; alt=&#34;the website&amp;#39;s homepage&#34;  &gt;
&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now that we are logged in we will need to navigate to the page where the virtual game is displayed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;league &amp;lt;- remdr$findElement(using = &#39;css selector&#39;, &amp;quot;.miBet9jaLeague&amp;quot;)
league$clickElement() # click on the League button in the page
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Sys.sleep(5) # giving the current page 5 seconds to finish loading its content
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;premier &amp;lt;- remdr$findElement(using = &#39;css selector&#39;, &amp;quot;.col-xs-6:nth-child(1) &amp;gt; div&amp;quot;)
premier$clickElement() # click on the premier button
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Sys.sleep(20) # giving the current page 20 seconds to finish loading its content
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now we are at the page we want to scrape from&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;





  











&lt;figure &gt;


  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;/img/web-scraping-selenium/Bet9jaVirtualHome.png&#34; &gt;


  &lt;img src=&#34;/img/web-scraping-selenium/Bet9jaVirtualHome.png&#34; alt=&#34;the website&amp;#39;s virtual football main page&#34;  &gt;
&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;






  











&lt;figure &gt;


  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;/img/web-scraping-selenium/Bet9jaVirtualResult.png&#34; &gt;


  &lt;img src=&#34;/img/web-scraping-selenium/Bet9jaVirtualResult.png&#34; alt=&#34;the website&amp;#39;s virtual football result page&#34;  &gt;
&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We will extract some information from these pages to make our dataset. The information in these pages changes every 2 minutes so we will need to create a while-loop so that we can capture all the information we need even as it changes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a list of what we will need from these pages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the bet week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the bet countdown timer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the match table&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the result table&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a little problem that we have to address before proceeding to get this data. Unlike the other pages where we just went ahead to get Elements from, in this page the Elements are inside a frame (use the selector gadget to verify), this restricts us from carrying out the findElement method that we have been using for the other pages directly. The RSelenium web driver provides us methods to handle situations like this, we will first need to switch to the frame so we can have access to the data therein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;iframe = remdr$findElement(using = &amp;quot;css selector&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;#playAreaFrame&amp;quot;)

remdr$switchToFrame(iframe)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**We have switched to the frame and can now perform the findElement method to obtain the data that we need. **&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final step:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;bet9ja &amp;lt;- NULL  ## initialize an empty data frame
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;TimeIn2days &amp;lt;- Sys.time() + 172800 ## we get the day and time we want our loop to exit

## 172800 in seconds is equivalent to 48hours

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## set a while loop so that we can get the data we need continuously every two minutes for as long as we want ##
while (Sys.time() &amp;lt;= TimeIn2days) { ## checks if the current day is equal or less than 2 days later, stops running if it isn&#39;t..
  
  ## we then locate and get the element of the betweek of the game which we will use as variable in our dataset ##
  betweek &amp;lt;- remdr$findElement(using = &#39;css selector&#39;, &amp;quot;#leagueWeek&amp;quot;)
  betweek &amp;lt;- unlist(betweek$getElementText())
  
  ## we locate the countdown element and then convert it to numeric (the time we have left before the game starts),
  # this is very important ##
  
  countdown &amp;lt;- remdr$findElement(using = &#39;css selector&#39;,&amp;quot;#bets-time-betContdown&amp;quot;)
  countdown1 &amp;lt;- as.numeric(substr(unlist(countdown$getElementText()), 1, 2))
  countdown2 &amp;lt;- as.numeric(substr(unlist(countdown$getElementText()), 4, 5))
    
  ## we locate the main table where the countries to play against each other and their odds are, and we store it 
  # in a variable mtable(match table) ##
  
  mtable &amp;lt;- remdr$findElement(using = &#39;css selector&#39;, &amp;quot;#tab_id_Match_Result&amp;quot;)
  mtable &amp;lt;-unlist(strsplit(unlist(mtable$getElementText()), &amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;))
  mtable &amp;lt;- mtable[-1]
  
  ## we will need a precise timing to be able to capture the result of the matches accurately. 
  # the matches gets played and the final results is displayed in the 28th second, So we pause our code using an 
  #addition of the time we have left from the current page where we got the betweek and the match table with the 28th 
  # second of the next page where we will obtain the final result of the games played. ##
  
  Sys.sleep((countdown1 * 60) + countdown2 + 28)
  
  ## now we get the result of the games played and clean it up a bit ##
  rstable &amp;lt;- remdr$findElement(using = &#39;css selector&#39;, &amp;quot;#live-list-match&amp;quot;)
  rstable &amp;lt;- unlist(strsplit(unlist(rstable$getElementText()), &amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;))
  rstable &amp;lt;- rstable[-c(4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40)]
  
  ## make a data frame with variavbles: home, away, homeOdd, drawOdd, awayOdd, homeR, awayR, matchtime, leagueWK 
  # and day ##
  
  df = data.frame(
    home = paste0(substr(mtable[seq(2,29,3)], 1,3)),
    away = paste0(substr(mtable[seq(2,29,3)], 7,9)),
    homeOdd = paste0(substr(mtable[seq(3,30,3)], 1,4)),
    drawOdd = paste0(substr(mtable[seq(3,30,3)], 6,9)),
    awaysOdd = paste0(substr(mtable[seq(3,30,3)], 11,14)),
    homeR = paste0(substr(rstable[seq(1,28,3)], 5,5)),
    awayR = paste0(substr(rstable[seq(3,30,3)], 1,1)),
    matchtime = mtable[1], ## the time a match was played as a variable
    leagueWK = betweek,  ## the week a match was played as a variable
    day = weekdays(Sys.Date()) ## the day a match was played as a variable
  )
  ## Note: i am able to do the above step because i scraped the data before this tutorial and noted the 
  #position of the information i needed. ##
  
  
  ## bind rows and save the dataset in the current directory of your rstudio
  bet9ja &amp;lt;- rbind(bet9ja, df)
  write_csv(bet9ja, &amp;quot;bet9ja.csv&amp;quot;)
  
  
  ## Navigate back to the page, switch to the frame and do this till the while loop becomes &amp;quot;FALSE&amp;quot; (2 days later) ##
  remdr$navigate(&amp;quot;https://vsmobile.bet9ja.com/bet9ja-mobile/login/?mode=premier&amp;amp;lang=tryhtml_iframe&amp;quot;)

iframe = remdr$findElement(using = &amp;quot;css selector&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;#playAreaFrame&amp;quot;)
remdr$switchToFrame(iframe)

Sys.sleep(25)
  }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The above while loop will run continuously for 2 days and each time a loop is completed a dataset gets saved to the current working directory rstudio is pointing to and it will subsequently get overwritten until the loop completes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;you should get a data frame like the one below after each run&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;





  











&lt;figure &gt;


  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;/img/web-scraping-selenium/betgames.png&#34; &gt;


  &lt;img src=&#34;/img/web-scraping-selenium/betgames.png&#34; alt=&#34;scraped data in an excel sheet&#34;  &gt;
&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes exactly 2 minutes for a game circle to be completed (match-fix-time + match-play-time), so if you do exactly what was taught in this tutorial, after 2 days of looping you should get a dataset with &lt;span style = &#34;color:blue;&#34;&gt; 10 x 30 x 48 &lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;=&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style = &#34;color:blue;&#34;&gt; 14400 &lt;/span&gt; observations for 2 days..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have gotten the dataset that  we want, our next step is to build a model to see how well we can predict the outcome of any match in the virtual football game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;please-refer-to-this-posthahahugoshortcode-s8-hbhb-for-the-modelling-part&#34;&gt;Please refer to this 
&lt;a href=&#34;/post/tidymodels-virtual-football-prediction/&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; for the modelling part&amp;hellip;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;wrap-up&#34;&gt;Wrap-up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use both rvest and RSelenium for web scraping and i must say, both are excellent tools that will always get the job done, the rvest package has a lot of people using it compared to the RSelenium package so you will most likely get solutions online for most rvest related problems than RSelenium.&lt;/p&gt;
